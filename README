Net-WebFunk-API
===============

The README is used to introduce the module and provide instructions on
how to install the module, any machine dependencies it may have (for
example C compilers and installed libraries) and any other information
that should be provided before the module is installed.

A README file is required for CPAN modules since CPAN extracts the
README file from a module distribution so that people browsing the
archive can use it get an idea of the modules uses. It is usually a
good idea to provide version information here so that people can
decide whether fixes for the module are worth downloading.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

QUICK START

cd WebFunk
mkdir -p /var/www/exposed/MyProject
sed '1,1s/Net::WebFunk::API::Exposed/MyProject/g' lib/Net/WebFunk/API/Exposed/Template.pm > /var/www/exposed/MyProject/Template.pm

Create /etc/httpd/conf.d/WebFunk.conf with:

	<Location /api>
        # so we don't have to restart the server every time
        PerlInitHandler Apache2::Reload
        PerlSetVar ReloadAll On

        SetHandler perl-script
        PerlSetVar WebFunkRoot '/var/www/exposed'
        PerlSetVar WebFunkExpRoot 'MyProject'
        PerlResponseHandler Net::WebFunk::API::Apache2
	</Location>

Restart Apache and go to http://localhost/api and you should see the doc for 
modules exposed as part of "MyProject". "Template" should be the only one at this
point.
